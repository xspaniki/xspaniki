ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm software developer ðŸ’» focused mainly on Ruby and JavaScript (e.g. Vue). 
I have more than 5 years professional experiences not only with writing code but also with project management, system analysis, data modelling or software engineering. 
I prefer writing clean, maintanable and reusable code also with focus on high performance. 
I like to learn new interesting technologies and I also improve my knowledges. 
I'm self-critical and I don't like to conclude anything with which I'm not satisfied enough...
